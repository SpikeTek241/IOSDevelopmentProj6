# Project 6 - *Tumblr (Detail Viewer)*

Submitted by: **Kevin Jerome**

**Tumblr Detailed Viewer** is an app that is an iOS app that displays a Tumblr photo feed (from Humans of New York) using the Tumblr API. Users can tap on a post to view a full image and detailed caption on a separate screen.
 [TODO] 

Time spent: **7+** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Setup navigation to the Detail Screen
- [x] Created the Detail View UI
- [x] Add the ability to pass data to the Detail View Controller
- [x] Made personal finishing touches to the UI


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Embedded Navigation Controller to allow push transitions + back button
- [x] Used Auto Layout and content mode (`AspectFit`) to properly size images
- [x] Added a navigation title ("Post Detail") for better UX

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
### Challenges Faced:
- Decoding Tumblrâ€™s deeply nested JSON to get the `original_size` image URL
- Removing strange characters from HTML-encoded caption strings
- Getting the navigation controller setup to enable proper back functionality
- Fixing broken `IBOutlet` references that crashed the app
- Understanding content mode and layout constraints for proper image rendering
